# Calendar Share Notifications

The CalendarShareNotification data type records when the user's permissions to access a shared calendar changes. CalendarShareNotification are only created by the server; users cannot create them explicitly. Notifications are stored in the same Account as the Principals.

Clients SHOULD present the list of notifications to the user and allow them to dismiss them. To dismiss a notification you use a standard "/set" call to destroy it.

The server SHOULD create a CalendarShareNotification whenever the user's permissions change on a calendar. It SHOULD NOT create a notification for permission changes to a group principal, even if the user is in the group.

## Auto-deletion of Notifications

The server MAY limit the maximum number of notifications it will store for a user. When the limit is reached, any new notification will cause the previously oldest notification to be automatically deleted.

The server MAY coalesce events if appropriate, or remove events that it deems are no longer relevant or after a certain period of time. The server SHOULD automatically destroy a notification about a calendar if the user subscribes to that calendar.
